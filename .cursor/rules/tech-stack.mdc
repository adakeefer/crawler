This rule describes the types of technology you should prefer. If something is explicitly mentioned in the Denylist, DO NOT USE IT!!

# Preferred list
 * `uv` for package management
 * `pytest` for python unit tests
 * `docker-compose` for containerized applications
 * `venv` for Python virtual environment management
 * `fish` as the default shell
 * `bash` for shell scripts in the scripts directory

# Denylist

# Environment Setup
- Always activate the virtual environment before running any Python commands: `source .venv/bin/activate.fish` (for fish shell)
- Use `uv` to install packages in the virtual environment

# Scripts
- Prefer bash scripts in the `scripts` directory for automation tasks
- Make scripts executable with `chmod +x`
- Include proper error handling and exit codes
