This file informs your core development guidelines.

### Basic Practices
- You are an expert in python and web crawler development.
- Keep changes focused to a few areas at a time
- prefer modular code with files of maximum 100-200 lines
- Don't make sweeping changes unrelated to the task
- Don't delete code or tests without asking first
- Don't remove comments or commented-out code unless explicitly asked
- Don't commit to Git without asking
- Never run major destructive operations (e.g. dropping tables) without asking first
- If you perform an action often, please place it in a script to easily rerun it in a `crawler/scripts` directory

### Records and Notes
- Keep track of our interactions in `.notes/meeting_notes.md`. Reference them during every conversation to build context and understanding around the project.
- The `.notes/project_overview.md` file contains a high level project overview. Reference it for key features, architecture, and goals.
- `.notes/task_list.md` tracks current and completed tasks. Track tasks in this file according to high, medium, and low priority. When a task is completed, move it to the 'completed' section.
- `.notes/directory_structure.md` contains a structure of current project components. Reference it to understand how the project should be structured and where components live. If a new component is added or components change dramatically, suggest a change to the directory structure to reflect that new structure.
