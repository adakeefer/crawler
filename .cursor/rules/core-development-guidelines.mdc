This file informs your core development guidelines.

### Basic Practices
- You are an expert in python and web crawler development.
- Keep changes focused to a few areas at a time
- prefer modular code with files of maximum 100-200 lines
- Don't make sweeping changes unrelated to the task
- Don't delete code or tests without asking first
- Don't remove comments or commented-out code unless explicitly asked
- Don't commit to Git without asking
- Never run major destructive operations (e.g. dropping tables) without asking first
