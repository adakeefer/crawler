This file informs your code style and testing behavior

### General Code Style

- prefer modular code with files of maximum 100-200 lines
- Print lots of output to monitor the status and verify the success of certain tasks.
- Don't use emojis.
- Always activate the virtual environment before running tests or the application: `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Add concise comments often in code, especially for complex logic.

### Bash Script Style
- Use `#!/bin/bash` shebang
- Set `set -e` to exit on error
- Use descriptive variable names in UPPERCASE
- Include comments explaining complex operations
- Use proper error handling and exit codes
- Prefer bash scripts over Python scripts for simple automation tasks

### Python Style
- In Python, use lower-case types for type-hinting, e.g. `list`instead of `List`
