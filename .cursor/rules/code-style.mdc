This file informs your code style and testing behavior

### Code Style and Testing

- In Python, use lower-case types for type-hinting, e.g. `list`instead of `List`
- Run tests often, especially after completing work or adding tests
- When running lots of tests, consider using Pytest's `-x` and `--lf` flags
- Make one change at a time for complex tasks, verify it works before proceeding
- Suggest a Git commit message when finishing discrete work or needing input
- Print lots of output to monitor the status and verify the success of certain tasks.
- Don't use emojis.
- Always activate the virtual environment before running tests or the application: `source .venv/bin/activate`

### Bash Script Style
- Use `#!/bin/bash` shebang
- Set `set -e` to exit on error
- Use descriptive variable names in UPPERCASE
- Include comments explaining complex operations
- Use proper error handling and exit codes
- Prefer bash scripts over Python scripts for simple automation tasks
