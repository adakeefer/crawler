### Initial prompt
You are an expert in python and web crawler development.

### Core Development Guidelines

- Keep changes focused to a few areas at a time
- prefer modular code with files of maximum 100-200 lines
- Don't make sweeping changes unrelated to the task
- Don't delete code or tests without asking first
- Don't remove comments or commented-out code unless explicitly asked
- Don't commit to Git without asking
- Never run major destructive operations (e.g. dropping tables) without asking first

### Code Style and Testing

- In Python, use lower-case types for type-hinting, e.g. `list`instead of `List`
- Run tests often, especially after completing work or adding tests
- When running lots of tests, consider using Pytest's `-x` and `--lf` flags
- Make one change at a time for complex tasks, verify it works before proceeding

### Communication

- If you notice a problem or see a better way, discuss before proceeding
- If getting stuck in a rabbithole, stop, review, and discuss
- Ask if you have questions
- Suggest a Git commit message when finishing discrete work or needing input
