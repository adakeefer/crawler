This file informs your code style and testing behavior

### Code Style and Testing

- In Python, use lower-case types for type-hinting, e.g. `list`instead of `List`
- Run tests often, especially after completing work or adding tests
- When running lots of tests, consider using Pytest's `-x` and `--lf` flags
- Make one change at a time for complex tasks, verify it works before proceeding
- Suggest a Git commit message when finishing discrete work or needing input
