# Meeting Notes

## 2024-03-26: Infrastructure Setup

### Completed Tasks
- Set up core infrastructure using Docker Compose:
  - Redis for URL queue and worker coordination
  - MinIO for content storage (S3-compatible)
  - MongoDB for link storage
- Created test script to verify infrastructure connections
- Set up Python virtual environment using UV
- Added requirements.txt with necessary dependencies

### Technical Decisions
- Chose Redis for URL queue due to its simplicity and performance
- Selected MinIO for S3-compatible storage to allow local development
- Used MongoDB for link storage to handle graph-like data structures
- Implemented health checks for all services
- Used UV for Python package management as per tech stack requirements

### Next Steps
- Consider adding specific configurations for each service
- Set up initial data structures in MongoDB
- Create default buckets in MinIO
- Begin implementing URL frontier and worker components

### Notes
- Always consult code-style.mdc, core-development-guidelines.mdc, and tech-stack.mdc for basic rules
- Infrastructure is ready for development with all services running and tested

## 2024-03-26: Test Infrastructure

### Completed Tasks
- Created test runner script using pytest
- Fixed infrastructure tests to use proper assertions
- Added Python-specific patterns to .gitignore
- Set up proper test environment with pytest configuration

### Technical Decisions
- Used pytest with flags:
  - `-x`: stop on first failure
  - `-v`: verbose output
  - `--lf`: run last failed tests first
- Improved test assertions for better error reporting
- Fixed MinIO test to handle empty bucket list case

### Notes
- All infrastructure tests passing
- Test runner script available at `crawler/scripts/run_tests.py`
- Virtual environment properly configured with UV and pytest

## 2024-03-26: Skeleton Components Implementation

### Completed Tasks
- Created skeleton worker process:
  - Connects to Redis, MongoDB, and MinIO
  - Logs connection status
  - Includes error handling
- Created skeleton URL frontier process:
  - Connects to Redis only (removed MongoDB connection as it's not needed)
  - Logs connection status
  - Includes error handling
- Added comprehensive tests for both components
- Fixed test mocking issues with MinIO import

### Technical Decisions
- Separated URL frontier and worker into distinct files
- URL frontier only connects to Redis (URL queue)
- Worker connects to all services (Redis, MongoDB, MinIO)
- Used proper Python logging
- Implemented thorough error handling
- Used environment variables for configuration

### Notes
- All component tests passing
- Components ready for further feature implementation
- Remember to follow these steps when completing tasks:
  1. Commit changes
  2. Record meeting notes
  3. Mark item as complete in task list
  4. Update directory structure if applicable

### Next Steps
- Begin implementing controller component
- Add specific functionality to URL frontier and worker

## 2024-03-26: Directory Structure Reorganization

### Completed Tasks
- Reorganized components into proper directory structure:
  - Created `crawler/components/` directory
  - Moved worker into `crawler/components/worker/`
  - Moved URL frontier into `crawler/components/url_frontier/`
- Updated test imports to reflect new file locations
- Added directory structure documentation notes

### Technical Decisions
- Each component now has its own directory for better organization
- Component-specific files (tests, utilities) can be added to component directories
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing tests

### Notes
- All tests passing after reorganization
- Directory structure now matches documentation
- Added notes about directory creation requirements

### Next Steps
- Consider moving component-specific tests into component directories
- Add component-specific configuration files

## 2024-03-26: Component Containerization

### Completed Tasks
- Containerized URL frontier and worker components:
  - Created Dockerfiles for both components
  - Added health checks to both components
  - Implemented continuous run loops
  - Added proper error handling and logging
- Created start script to manage infrastructure:
  - Builds and starts all services
  - Runs health checks with retries
  - Supports scaling worker instances
  - Provides colored status output

### Technical Decisions
- Used Python slim base image for smaller container size
- Implemented health checks using component-specific logic
- Added continuous run loops to prevent container exit
- Used environment variables for service configuration
- Created bash script for infrastructure management

### Notes
- All containers successfully connect to required services
- Health checks verify all connections
- Start script provides clear status feedback
- Infrastructure can be started with a single command

### Next Steps
- Begin implementing controller component
- Add specific functionality to URL frontier and worker
- Consider adding monitoring and metrics
